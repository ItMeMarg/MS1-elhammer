#  Ylva/Ulf Elhammer - Tattoo Apprentice Portfolio 

This project is a portfolio website for Seattle-based non-binary tattoo apprentice Ylva/Ulf Elhammer. Their mentor is [Jude Le Tronik](https://judeletronik.com), a well-known Queer tattoo artist and the owner of [Lilith Tattoo](https://lilithtattooseattle.com). All artists at Lilith have a personal website linked from the studio’s [Artists page](https://lilithtattooseattle.com/artists)—except Elhammer! This website will help grow both awareness of and interest in their work, as well as allow perspective clients to connect with them.

##  UX

*  As a potential client interested in supporting a QTPOC-owned tattoo studio, I want to learn more about Elhammer’s identity and work. I want to see both a biography and a gallery of their work to decide if I am interested in working with them.

*  As a potential client interested in working with Elhammer, I want to be able to contact them to set up an appointment/commission a piece of art.

This website was designed to complement the design and overall “feel” of [Lilith Tattoo’s website](https://lilithtattooseattle.com). To accomplish this, we committed to a black/grey color scheme with maximum white space. Initial [wireframes](../wireframes/milestone1.pdf) do not include features we added for better UX.

When choosing a font, we wanted to honor Elhammer’s Swedish heritage. We found Josefin Sans to feature as the sole font used on the website; as [Figma](https://figma.com/google-fonts/josefin-sans-font-pairings/) notes, it “reflects Swedish design.” To ensure usability, we set the “ylva/ulf elhammer” #navbar-brand, headings, and paragraphs to a weight of 300; we set the #navbar-menu to a bolder weight of 600. This design choice differentiates features without the need for an additional font type. 


##  Features

###  Existing Features

*  Carousel showing select pieces from Elhammer’s portfolio - brings in users’ attention immediately when landing on the site and allows them to see some of Elhammer’s work.
*  Contact form - the chosen questions/inputs are minimal enough to keep the user’s attention and make it simple to complete and send the form.
*  Portfolio gallery - allows users to initially see an overview of Elhammer’s work as smaller thumbnails. When selected, images enlarge in a modal. 
*  Fixed navigation bar and footer - offers quick navigation to other pages or Elhammer’s social media accounts.
*  Envelope icon on footer - brings the user to the contact page, allowing them the option to reach out at any point of their visit. 
*  “ylva/ulf elhammer” navbar brand - maintains name awareness throughout the user’s time on the website. 
*  burger button - collapsing the navigation bar on medium and smaller screens offers a cleaner appearance for users, decreasing visual overload or layout clunkiness. 

###  Features Left to Implement
*  Further editing of Portfolio gallery modal, particularily sizing; this requires more knowledge of JavaScript, which I have not yet acquired. :)
*  Separate contact pages for illustration and tattoo appointments with more detailed contact forms, as well as portfolio pages with more images.
