# Ylva/Ulf Elhammer - Tattoo Apprentice Portfolio 

This website is a portfolio for Seattle-based tattoo apprentice Ylva/Ulf Elhammer. They are currently working under well-known and respected Queer artist, Jude Le Tronik, at Lilith Tattoo. Elhammer is nearing the end of their apprenticeship and needs a comprehensive site, wherein they can showcase both their tattoo and illustrative work.
 
## UX

The site's design deliberately compliments Lilith Tattoo Studio's and Jude Le Tronik's own websites for the sake of consistancy.
Specifically, similarities can be seen in the following elements and sections: 
- Navigation: bold serif font
- Porfolio page: maintained two-column style for images, as is seen on Lilith's Studio page

A marked difference between Ylva/Ulf and Lilith's page is the minimal amount of text we included. Rather than overload users with information and elements, we decided to provide a minimal base of information with direction to the studio's homepage. This also allows Ylva/Ulf's page to be easily updated if they move to another studio, for example. 


User Stories: 
- As a new client, I want to have a designated website I can visit to see Ylva/Ulf's work. I want to see their portfolio to determine if their style matches my needs.
- As a return client, I want to see what Ylva/Ulf's been up to and learn more about their backstory. I can do this by looking at their Portfolio, About, and utilize the Contact page.

Diagrams are located in the Wireframes directory. Aspects that were changed to increase UI was a seperate About page and a carousel on the Index page. Additionally, unnecessary text was deleted to maximize minimalism. 


## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Index/Home - The main feature of this page is a carousel with select images from Ylva/Ulf's portfolio.
About - Ylva/Ulf's About features one image of them tattooing and a brief biography. 
Contact - To maintain a clean page, the main feature is a contact form which autofocuses to prompt a user to fill out the form. 
Porftfolio - The portfolio page was designed to mirror Lilith Tattoo Studio's own site, so on smaller screens displays images in one column and, on larger screens, in two columns. 

Navigation - We used a navbar brand to bring Ylva/Ulf's identity to the forefront of their page. We kept a clean, straight-forward approach for the nav bar menu items. This is done through font size, alignment, and white space as well as a toggler/collapsable menu button based on responsivness. 
Footer - Ylva/Ulf's two social media accounts (Instagram and Pinterest) are hyperlinked by centered icons. The Message icon brings users to the contact form.


### Existing Features

 -- Allows users to get to know Ylva/Ulf's skill upon arrival by featuring a full-sized carousel of selected tattoos and illustrations.

- Navigation 
 -- The large/very present "ylva/ulf elhammer" maintains name awareness. The burger button keeps a clean apperance. 


In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Separate pages for Illustrative work and Tattoo work. These pages could also lead to appropriate contact forms for tattoo versus illustrative commissions (e.g., rates, appointments)

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap 4** to ease site responsiveness. 

- [HTML] 

- [CSS]


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

While constructing this site, I used Google Chrome's "Inspect" feature to view pages at each responsiveness point. Doing so was very helpful in setting paddings/borders/margins. 

Problems / bugs

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
